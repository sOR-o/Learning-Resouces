Introduction

Machine learning involves the processes of learning, reasoning, and decision-making based on data. 
This is achieved by developing computer programs that process data, extract valuable insights, make predictions about unknown properties, 
and recommend appropriate actions or decisions. What distinguishes data analysis as machine learning is the automation of these processes, 
where computer programs are trained to adapt to application-specific scenarios by adjusting their settings based on observed training data. 
In essence, machine learning can be regarded as a form of programming by example. The versatility of machine learning lies in its ability to handle various types of data, 
and it offers general methods applicable to a wide range of practical domains. In this paper, we illustrate this versatility through various examples.

The term 'generic computer program' in the context above corresponds to a mathematical model of the data. Consequently, 
when describing different machine learning methods, we employ mathematical language to define relationships between the observed data, relevant variables, 
and the properties of interest, such as predictions or actions. This mathematical model serves as a concise representation of the data, 
capturing essential characteristics of the phenomenon under investigation. The choice of which model to employ is often guided by insights gained from examining the available data and the practitioner's domain-specific knowledge. 
When implementing these methods in practice, the mathematical model is translated into executable computer code. However, comprehending the underlying mathematics is crucial for a deep understanding of the functioning of the computer program.

As previously mentioned, the model (or computer program) is learned based on available training data. 
This learning process is accomplished through the utilization of a learning algorithm capable of automatically adjusting the model's parameters to align 
with the data. In summary, the fundamental components of machine learning can be summarized as follows:

The Data
The Mathematical Model
The Learning Algorithm

In this introductory chapter, we aim to provide an overview of the machine learning problem by illustrating these foundational elements with several 
diverse examples from various application domains. Despite their differences, these examples can all be addressed using similar machine learning techniques. 
Additionally, we offer guidance on how to navigate the rest of this paper. Finally, we provide references to recommended books on machine learning for 
readers interested in delving deeper into this subject.
