Supervised Machine Learning
Supervised Machine Learning: In supervised machine learning, you work with training data that consists of examples demonstrating the relationship between an
 input variable (commonly denoted as "x") and an output variable (commonly denoted as "y"). The goal is to predict the output "y" for new, 
 unseen test data for which only the input "x" is known. This process involves using a mathematical model or method adapted to the training data and 
 typically requires computations performed on a computer.

Learning from Labelled Data: In most real-world supervised machine learning applications, the relationship between the input "x" and output "y" is complex
 and challenging to describe explicitly. It may be too intricate or not fully understood from domain knowledge. Consequently, it's not feasible to solve the
  problem by writing a traditional computer program with predefined rules. Instead, supervised machine learning involves learning this relationship from data, 
  which contains observed pairs of input and output values. Essentially, it's about learning from examples.

Training Data: The data used for learning is referred to as "training data," and it consists of multiple input-output data points or samples, denoted as 
(xi, yi), with a total of "n" samples. These samples are assumed to be independent in most cases, excluding applications like time series analysis, where 
the correlation between consecutive samples is of interest. The fact that training data contains both input values "x" and output values "y" is why it's 
called "supervised" machine learning.

Input and Output Terminology: Inputs ("x") are sometimes referred to as features, attributes, predictors, regressors, covariates, explanatory variables, 
controlled variables, or independent variables. Outputs ("y") can be called responses, regressands, labels, explained variables, predicted variables, 
or dependent variables.

Data Types: Data variables can be categorized into two types: numerical and categorical. Numerical variables have a natural ordering, 
allowing for comparisons of magnitude. Categorical variables, on the other hand, are discrete and lack natural ordering. 
They have a finite set of distinct values. The choice between numerical and categorical often depends on the specific problem and the machine learning 
engineer's judgment.

This distinction between numerical and categorical variables applies to both the input variables ("x") and the output variable ("y"). 
It's possible to have a mix of numerical and categorical inputs in a machine learning problem.
